# About me

Hey, I'm Morgan Ridel, a backend software engineer with a love for automation and DevOps.

Throughout my career, I've worked on various backends built with **Java**, **Python** and **Typescript**. In my personal projects I like to dabble in different technologies like **Elixir**.

I would describe myself as a generalist. I love to learn new stuff and get a good grasp on everything, but I can deep dive into the subject of the day when needed.

I have a deep appreciation for well-oiled CI/CD pipelines and avoiding human errors without a fuss thanks to different automations.

In my free time, I enjoy:

* Self-hosting services at home
* 3D printing
* Board games and video games
* Cooking
* Learning stuff
* Teaching stuff

You can contact me at **mail \[at\] morganridel \[dot\] fr**.
